## Adventure Game Master 

This is a simple text-based adventure game powered by AI emotion detection and music integration.



## Features

- Turn-based storytelling with emotional branching
- Emotion analysis based on player input
- Dynamic background music using `pygame`
- Agent-based system design with [Google ADK](https://github.com/google/agent-development-kit)
- All story content is presented in both Traditional Chinese and English for accessibility and immersion.
- Modular design with exposed agent tools (start, process, status, stop, diagnostics) for integration with LLM agents
